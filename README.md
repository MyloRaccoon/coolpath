# CoolPath
Because windows suck, here's a Cool windows PATH CLI util to quickly manage values in your PATH env.
It probably already exists but I'm too lazy to search for a new tool so I built it myself with rust.

## Commands
### list
lists all paths in your PATH

### search <needle>
shows every paths in your PATH containing the needle.

### exists <path>
checks if a path exists in your PATH or not.

### add <path>
adds a path to your PATH.

### remove <path>
removes a path from your PATH.

## Installation
idk build it yourself. 
It's rust so just cargo build or something.
